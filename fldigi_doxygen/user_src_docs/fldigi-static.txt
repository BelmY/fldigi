\section precompiled_binary Precompiled Binary

The precompiled binary is available with and without a dependency on
PulseAudio.  Unless you know that your system uses PulseAudio
for its sound card service you should not download that version.
<br>

You will need three shared libraries on your system, hamlib-1.2.10;
libsamplerate; and libportaudio2.  Use the libraries available
for your linux distribution.  Most current distributions use
either deb or rpm files and can be accessed from a global repository.
<br>

Building the libraries from source should be a last resort unless you
are a knowledgable Linux user and have performed a library build from
source in the past.
<br>

\subsection hamlib_required Hamlib

You will need to have hamlib-1.2.7 installed on your system before
fldigi can be executed.  Most current distributions either
have a deb or rpm distribution file for hamlib-1.2.10.  If you must
compile from source you can find it at:
<br>
    <a href="http://www.hamlib.org/">http://www.hamlib.org</a>
<br>

Follow the instructions in the source code top directory to compile,
link and install the library.
<br>

\subsection libsamplerate_required libsamplerate
<br>

You will need to have libsample installed on your system
before fldigi can be executed.  Most current distributions either
have a deb or rpm distribution file for libsamplerate.  If you must
compile from source you can find it at:
<br>

<a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html">libsamplerate
source</a>
<br>

Follow the instructions in the source code top directory to compile,
link and install the library.
<br>

\subsection port_audio_required PortAudio

You will need to have libportaudio2 installed on your system before
fldigi can be executed.  Most current distributions either
have a deb or rpm distribution file for libportaudio2.  If you must
compile from source you can find it at:<br>
<br>
    <a href="http://www.portaudio.com">http://www.portaudio.com</a>
<br>

Follow the instructions in the source code top directory to compile,
link and install the library.

\section installing_fldigi Installing fldigi

The static executables are tested on as many distributions
as possible to insure that they work "out-of-the-box", but there are
always a few Linux distributions that may have a missing link or
library.  The precompiled binaries have been tested and work
correctly on all of the Debian and Ubuntu/Kubuntu distributions. They
have also been tested and confirmed to work on Suse 10.1,
and Mandriva 2007.
<br>

Download the tarball for the binary version and unpack to a
directory on your HD such as $HOME/bin or some other convenient
directory of your choosing.  The least common denominator for
unpacking a tarball is to download the file and save it to a convenient
directory such as $HOME/downloads.  Then open up a terminal
window.  Assuming you will be installing the executable to
$HOME/bin do the following and that you have downloaded the tarball to
$HOME/downloads
<br>

\verbatim
cd
cd bin
tar xzf ../downloads/fldigi-D.dd.npa.bin.tgz
\endverbatim

where D.dd is the current version number as in 3.10
<br>

You can create a link to the fldigi executable on your desktop
using the fldigi.png icon located at
<br>

<a href="http://www.w1hkj.com/fldigi-distro/fldigi-psk.png">http://www.w1hkj.com/fldigi-distro/fldigi-psk.png</a>
<br>

Creating a desktop link to an application is different for each desktop
manager, so please refer to the documentation for your specific manager.
<br>

The first time that you execute fldigi either from the command line or
by clicking on the executable in a file manager or the desktop icon it
will create a new directory and file:
<br>

<ul>
<li>$HOME/.fldigi</li>
<li>$HOME/.fldigi/macros.mdf</li>
</ul>

If this is a new installation you will be guided through some necessary
configuration by a \ref wizard_page "new install wizard".
