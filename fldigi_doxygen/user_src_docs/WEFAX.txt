This modem is able to receive and transmit HF-Fax images, traditionally used
for weather reports.
<br>

More technical information is available on the wikipedia
article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofax">Radiofax</a>.
<br>

Two modes are implemented IOC=576 or 288. The focus is made on
black-and-white images, color mode is still experimental.
<br>

Many frequencies are available
at <a href="http://www.hffax.com">http://www.hffax.com/</a> for example.
<br>

\section wefax_config Configuration.
As for any modem, weather fax has its own tab in the configuration window.

\subsection logging_adif Logging messages to ADIF file

Each time an image is saved, it is possible to log this event, with the
frequency and reception time, to the Adif file. This option is disabled by
default.

\subsection fsk_adjust Frequency shift adjustment

The default frequency is 800 Hz. However, it is possible to adjust for
example to 850 Hz for Deutsche Wetter Dienst.
<br>

\subsection center_freq Center Frequency

Wefax transmissions are USB, with the center of the frequency modulated audio
signal center at 1900 Hertz.  This is the default value.

\subsection max_rows Maximum rows number

It non-continuous (Non non-stop) reception mode, an image is
automatically saved when it has more than this number of lines
(Default 2500 lines). Once this number of rows is reached, the image
is saved and a new image is read with the same parameters. This feature
has two applications:
<br>

<ul>
	<li>In automatic mode (APT control), if an image end is not detected, we
	can guarantee that the result will take no more than, for example, the
	size of two faxes. Typical faxes have about 1300 lines, so the max lines
	parameters can be tuned to, for example, 200 lines.</li>
	<li>In manual mode, where images are read continuously, this cuts the
	received images into chunks of equal size.</li>
</ul>

\subsection auto_align Auto-align

The Wefax signal has start, stop, and phasing components to the transmission.  The 
decoder searches for the start signal, the stop signal and the phasing signal.  The 
phasing signal is used for auto alignment of the image.  You can specify the start, stop,
and interval for the alignment.<br>
<br>
Wefax images have a strong line to line correlation.  This correlation is used to 
detect a signal loss to prevent printing noise.  The image display is stopped when 
the correlation falls below the threshold as detected over the specified number of lines.

\subsection wefax_decoder_filter FIR filter

Select an input FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter:
<ul>
<li> narrow</li>
<li> medium</li>
<li> wide</li>
</ul>
There is rarely any QRM on a government WEFAX broadcast, but the filter selection might
improve the decoded signal to noise ratio.  Start with the medium filter setting.

\subsection dest_dir Destination directory for saved images

Received images are saved in the default folder

<tt>$HOME/.fldigi/images (Linux) or \<defaultpath\>/fldigi.files/images (Windows).</tt>
<br>

Additionally, they can be saved manually, at any time, using the button 'Save'.
<br>

\section rx_image Receiving an image
<br>

\image html Wefax-Rx.png "Reception"
\image latex Wefax-Rx.png "Reception" width=6.0in
<br>

A blank image is initially displayed. Several controls
are available:
<br>

<ul>
	<li>Save: This allows to save the current image as a PNG file at any
	moment.</li>
	<li>Clear: Clear the image</li>
	<li>Cont': At any moment, the image reception can be paused
	and resumed (State is displayed in the reception window label).</li>
	<li>Mag: Change the displayed magnification of the wefax image.</li>
	<li>Row: The number of the row (line) currently received.</li>
	<li>Tilt: This is used to adjust the slant of the image due to a part per
	million difference between the pc clock and the transmitting station
	clock. This value is saved in the configuration file, so it is
	not	needed to reenter it each time.</li>
	<li>Align: Used to manually adjust the horizontal center of
	the image, if it could not be detected in the phasing step.  The alignment
	value will be displayed if auto detected.</li>
	<li>Auto: When this button is set, the image will be automatically centered. This
	process occurs during the phasing interval of the wefax signal.</li>
	<li>Noise: Enable noise filtering.  This option eliminates short-lived noise, 
individual pixels with a different value from their horizontal neighbors. They are 
modified using median values. This is based on the fact that no line should be narrower than
two pixels, otherwise such an image would not be broadcast, because not
correctly readable. It is therefore impossible to have one single
pixel, simultaneously very different from its left and right neighbors.</li>
	<li>Bin: convert to binary image using the assocated level.  A weather fax 
can be stored as binary or grey level images. The cutoff level between
black and white (Default 128) can be adjusted. No information is lost
until the image is saved, therefore this level can be freely modified
until image end. The purpose of this option is to save disk space.
</li>
</ul>

\subsection display_files Displaying received files

Each time the end of an image is detected, an image file is created and stored
in the default Wefax image folder.  Open the folder with the system file finder 
using the menu item "File / Folder / WEFAX images...".  The images are saved
as a Portable Network Graphics file, with the extension ".png".  Use the system
image viewer to view the images.<br>
<br>

\section tx_image Transmitting an Image

To open the transmit window, select the menu item "View/Weather Fax Image TX"

Load an image file using the button "Load".
<br>

\image html Transmit_A.png "Transmitting"
\image latex Transmit_A.png "Transmitting" width=6.0in
<br>

Click "Tx B/W" to start the transmission. During transmission, image reception is
paused. The window will display each image line as it is sent. Please
be patient, this may take a while. You might note that FlDigi status
line displays the estimation transmit time, and the current stage
(Start, phasing etc...).
